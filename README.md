# Clarividencia
Clarividencia is a ReactJS based application.

It is a very simple guessing game. I built it right after I learned ReactJS, to get a hang of it.

The game comes with three difficulty levels:

Easy
Medium
Hard
Based on the difficulty level, the game engine generates a random number, which lies in between 0-10 for Easy, 0-50 for Medium and 0-100 for Hard. You then get to guess the number with the application giving you a clue every time you are wrong. Once you do guess the right number, you can also see the number of chances you took to do so.

Also, I made this game a PWA, so you only need an internet connection for the very time. After which you won't ever need an internet connection to play this game. Also, should you so choose, you can opt to install this game onto your mobile devices like a native app by clicking on the "Add to Homescreen" button.
